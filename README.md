### Contributing

This project uses [editorconfig](http://editorconfig.org/) to maintain consistent coding style. Make sure your text editor has an editorconfig [plugin](http://editorconfig.org/#download) installed.

**Atom Users:** The Whitespace plugin (which is installed by default) has `Trim trailing whitespace` option turned on by default. Turn this off in the Whitespace plugin settings, otherwise it overwrites the setting in [.editorconfig](.editorconfig). This is a known [issue](https://github.com/sindresorhus/atom-editorconfig/issues/3). This is only required for editing the slides. Workshop learners are not required to add this plugin.

Please refer to https://github.com/ladieslearningcode/llc-slidedeck-template for instructions for customization of the slide deck and features.
